First and foremost, the staff of SPI and the original designers of
\emph{Universe} deserve mention.  It seems like every time I think of
tweaking this or that rule, on closer examination I can see the
virtual fingerprints of a designer who already decided against the
change for reasons I had not yet thought of.  Here's the complete
list, as given on page "i" of SPI's \emph{Universe} 2nd Edition:

Ian Taylor deserves my endless thanks for having scanned original
Universe manuals and turned them into text in the first place.  His
web site at \url{http://members.iinet.net.au/~avalon1/}
is an invaluable source for more things Universe.

My thanks go out also to the members of the Yahoo! group
``Universe{\_}RPG'', who were an invaluable source of ideas, imagination
and practicality.
