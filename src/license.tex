\section*{Preamble}
\label{sec:preamble}



The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.


\section*{Definitions:}
\label{sec:definitions}


\begin{itemize}
\item ``Package'' refers to the collection of files distributed by the
  Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
  created through textual modification.
\item ``Standard Version'' refers to such a Package if it has not been
  modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
  Copyright Holder.
\item ``Copyright Holder'' is whoever is named in the copyright or
  copyrights for the package.
\item ``You'' is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
  this Package.
\item ``Reasonable copying fee'' is whatever you can justify on the
  basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
  and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
  Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
  that must bear the fee.)
\item ``Freely Available'' means that no fee is charged for the item
  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
  also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the
  same conditions they received it.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
  the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
  that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
  associated disclaimers.
\item You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
  modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
  Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered
  the Standard Version.
\item You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
  provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
  stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
  at least ONE of the following:
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
     make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications
     to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications
     on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the
     Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
     Version of the Package.
   \item use the modified Package only within your corporation or
     organization.
   \item rename any non-standard executables so the names do not
     conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided,
     and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
     executable that clearly documents how it differs from the
     Standard Version.
   \item make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright
     Holder.
\end{enumerate}

\item You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code
  or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the
  following:
   
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
    files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
    equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
  \item accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.
  \item accompany any non-standard executables with their
    corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the
    non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
    together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
  \item make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright
    Holder.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
  this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
  Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
  commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
  software distribution provided that you do not advertise this
  Package as a product of your own.
\item The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced
  as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically
  fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever
  generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated
  with this Package.
\item C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this
  Package shall not be considered part of this Package.
\item The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
  promote products derived from this software without specific prior
  written permission.
\item THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
