First and foremost, the staff of SPI and the original designers of
\emph{Universe} deserve mention.  It seems like every time I think of
tweaking this or that rule, on closer examination I can see the
virtual fingerprints of a designer who already decided against the
change for reasons I had not yet thought of.  Here's the complete
list, as given on page 16 of  SPI's \emph{Delta Vee}:

\begin{description}
\item[Game Design and Development:] John H. Butterfield
\item[Physical Systems and Graphics:] Redmond A. Simonsen
\item[Play testing:] Justin Leites, Darryl Esakof, David McCorkhill,
  Scott Laiken, Edward J. Woods, James Mulligan.
\item[Blindtesting:] David Spangler, Richard A. Edwards, Wes Devin,
  Mark Barrows and the Olympia Gaming Association
\item[Production:] Carolyn Felder, Ted Koller, Manfred F. Milkuhn,
  Michael E. Moore, Bob Ryer, Ken Stec
\end{description}
  
Ian Taylor deserves my endless thanks for having scanned original
Universe manuals and turned them into text in the first place.  His
web site at \url{http://members.iinet.net.au/~avalon1/}
is an invaluable source for more things Universe.

My thanks go out also to the members of the Yahoo! group
``Universe{\_}RPG'', who were an invaluable source of ideas,
imagination and practicality.
